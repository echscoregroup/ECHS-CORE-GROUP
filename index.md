<B>14 Jun 2021 – Migration to Web Portal from WhatsApp of Helping Hands For ECHS was initiated on 9 Jun 2021. As you are aware I am no longer posting information in WhatsApp except an advisory. Messages and other documents such as Procedures & Policy Letters are posted only in Web Portal. All members are requested to start using the Portal.So far I am observing the Hits (whoever visits at least once = 1 Hit)at the Portal is less than 80 daily.The Portal brings tremendous advantages to access ECHS information due to the way it has been designed. I look forward to maximum number of members using the Web Portal.</B>
